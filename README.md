<h1>Build Your Own Website with Thinkful</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use HTML and CSS to build your webpage</li>
  <li>You'll write your HTML content in the index.html file</li>
  <li>You'll style your content with the CSS content in the styles.css file</li>
</ul>

<h2>Building your website:</h2>

<p><b>Step 1: Making it your own.</b> Change the underline to your name!</p>
<p><b>Step 2: Add another section.</b> Add a section with a title and a paragraph describing where you're from.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: Change the paragraphs to reflect you.</b> Change the information in the paragraphs to be your own story.</p>
<p><b>Step 4: Make the footer stand out.</b> Decide on a color and change the background of the footer to be that color. Try googling "how to change background color on an html element".</p>
<p><b>Step 5: Link layout.</b> Center the links in the footer. Try googling "how to center html elements".</p>
<p><b>Step 6: Links to where?</b> Change the links to match your own social media pages.</p>
<p><b>Step 7: Indentation.</b> Add some margins space between the side of the page and the paragraphs about you. Try googling "how to set margins on html elements".</p>
<p><b>Step 8: Background Image.</b> Find a picture to replace the default background image. Try googling "how to change background-image css".</p>
<p><b>Step 9: Keep going!</b> At this point you've had some nice practice with making changes to the page and doing your own research with google. Now try to make changes to the page that YOU think are necessary. Use Google (and our TAs!) for help or suggestions on what to google. Be patient, layout is definitely a difficult concept to grasp.</p>

Here's a link to a working example of what your page could be. Feel free to gain some inspiration from it: https://html-css-template.glitch.me/


<b>Some suggestions for changes:</b>
<ul>
<li>Remove the dot from before the links in the footer.</li>
<li>Change the color of some of your text.</li>
<li>Change the background image to something you want.</li>
</ul>
